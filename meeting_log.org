* next goals:
** test perplexity on generated sentences
** include or re-implement code from White et.al.
** try encoding and decoding on a smaller set of words forming short sentences
* ideas:
** possibly use variational autoencoder to do the same thing

2018-12-19:
* last results:
** tested bag of words reconstruction on test sets with various sentence lengths (3-6,6-18,>12) and different vocabulary sizes (1000,2000)
** the results are always very good (every time, out of 1075 sentences more than 1000 were reconstructed correctly)
* next goals:
** Where are the sentences in space?
*** nearest neighbor among sentences
*** nearest neighbor in words
** retry bag of word reconstruction with whole matrix instead of just small subset
** test bag of word reconstruction in a more systematic way:
*** make bins of sentence lengths
*** use larger vocabulary
*** find number of words lost per sentence (avg with variance)
** use bigger corpus for training
** use bigram model to actually reconstruct sentence from bag of words
*** use SICK dataset for testing sentence similarity
* ideas:
** When we know where the vectors are in the space we could use that to speed up sentence reconstruction.

2019-01-09:
* last results:
** sentences are most similar to function words appearing in them
** systematic test of sentence reconstruction still running
** implemented sentence reconstruction
* next goals:
** find method for evaluating sentence reconstruction â†’ maybe cider?
** look into similar literature for report
** decide on date and format of the presentation
** find out more about the positions of the words and sentences in the space
