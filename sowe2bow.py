This module translates sowe2bow from
https://white.ucc.asn.au/publications/White2016BOWgen/ into python,
i.e. it implements the bag-of-words reconstruction algorithm.
The main method is greedy_search().

Attributes
----------
epsilon : float
    constant used for round off when comparing scores
    -- numbers whose difference is less than Ïµ are considered the same
